    "2. Backpropagation in the context of computer vision tasks involves the calculation of gradients to update the weights of a CNN during training. It starts with the computation of the loss between the predicted output and the ground truth labels. The gradients are then propagated backward through the network, layer by layer, using the chain rule of calculus.
